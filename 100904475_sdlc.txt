Devops is important to the software development lifecycle  process as it allows for development to
 be much faster and have easier maintenance of code. 

It is good for programmers as it allows them to easily roll back
the code when there are unforseen errors.

It also allows for easy correction of these errors as you can see the last stable version 
and which new changes could potentially be the issue.

Branching your code allows for you to try new things without causing issues with the current version.
