DevOps stand for Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). DevOps a working culture that combines software development engineers (dev) with operators (system engineers, security officers, network engineers, infrastructure engineers, etc) to shorten the product development life cycle (SDLC).DevOps is not a working tool, but a working method that needs the support of tools. Also, there aren't any standards for DevOps users to follow. It is simply a culture, a way of working together between devs and operations staff instead of working alone or just an independent team.
