We are all in our third year at George Brown College in the T127 Computer Programmer Analyst Program.

It is one of many programs offered by George Brown.

The program title has changed while I was a student to T177.

The courses offered are very similar but with a few differences in first year courses.

I had to take Intro to networking, they do not.
